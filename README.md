# 👋 Hi, I'm Mayank Verma

Frontend-focused engineer building **scalable, high-performance web applications**, now actively working across **frontend and backend boundaries**.

I enjoy designing systems where **UI, data flow, performance, and backend architecture** come together — especially in real-time and data-heavy applications.

---

## 🚀 What I Do Best

- Build **production-grade React applications** with long-term maintainability
- Design **scalable frontend architectures**, not just UI screens
- Optimize rendering, bundles, and runtime performance
- Work comfortably with backend APIs and data models
- Write clean, predictable code that scales with teams and features

---

## 🧠 Engineering Mindset

- Clarity over cleverness
- Measure before optimizing
- Design for scale and change
- Think in systems, not isolated features
- Make trade-offs explicit and intentional

---

## ⚡ Performance & Scalability

- Prevent unnecessary re-renders and state over-coupling
- Lazy loading, memoization, and code-splitting
- Browser performance profiling (FPS, memory, long tasks)
- Performance-aware component and state design
- Frontend patterns that scale with data and users

---

## 🏗️ Architecture & Backend Exposure

- Feature-based project structures
- Clear separation of UI, state, services, and APIs
- REST API design and consumption
- Working with **Node.js** services
- Using **Redis** for caching and fast data access
- Using **ClickHouse** for analytical and event-driven data
- Designing frontend systems aligned with backend contracts

---

## 🔁 Real-Time & Data-Heavy Systems

- Event-based data flows
- Real-time UI updates and synchronization
- Handling high-frequency events in frontend
- Performance-conscious rendering of large datasets
- Coordinating frontend state with backend events

---

## ♿ Accessibility (a11y)

- Semantic HTML & ARIA best practices
- Keyboard navigation & focus management
- Screen reader-friendly components
- Accessibility-aware UI systems

---

## 🔄 Automation & Developer Experience

- ESLint, Prettier & shared coding standards
- Git hooks for consistent quality
- CI pipelines for validation and builds
- Improving developer feedback loops

---

## 🧪 Testing Approach

- Write tests where they add confidence
- Focus on behavior, not implementation
- Prefer integration-level coverage for UI and APIs

---

## 📦 Currently Exploring

- Deeper backend architecture patterns
- API design and data consistency
- Real-time collaboration systems
- Frontend performance observability
- Better state synchronization strategies

---

## 🤝 Open To

- Frontend or frontend-heavy full-stack roles
- Performance & architecture-focused projects
- Systems with real-world scale and constraints
- Collaboration and open-source contributions

---

## 💻 Core Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React, Next.js, TypeScript, JavaScript  
**Backend:** Node.js, REST APIs  
**State:** Context API, Redux Toolkit  
**Data:** Redis, ClickHouse  
**Tooling:** Vite, Webpack, Storybook  
**Automation:** GitHub Actions, Jenkins  
**Quality:** ESLint, Prettier, Git hooks
