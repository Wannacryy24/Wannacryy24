# 👋 Hi, I’m Mayank Verma

Frontend-focused engineer building **scalable, high-performance web applications**, now working across **frontend and backend boundaries**.

Currently working on a **User Data Engine (UDE)** for **real-time user event collection, processing, and access**.  
Previously built a **real-time collaborative code editor** focused on **low-latency updates and shared state consistency**.

I enjoy designing systems where **UI, data flow, performance, and backend architecture** come together.

## 🧠 Engineering Focus

- Scalable React architecture & state management
- Real-time and data-heavy systems
- Performance-conscious UI design
- Frontend–backend contract alignment
- Clean, maintainable codebases

**Highlights:**
- Event-driven ingestion pipeline
- Redis for fast-access & transient state
- ClickHouse for analytical workloads
- Frontend systems consuming real-time + aggregated data

→ Detailed design, trade-offs, and scaling notes in the project README.
